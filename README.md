# ClearBlade Internet of Things (IoT) Core Client for Java

Java library and samples for [ClearBlade Internet of Things (IoT) Core][product-docs].

- [Product Documentation][product-docs]
- [Client Library Documentation][javasdk]

## Supported Java Versions

Java 11 or above is required for using this client. Java 17 is the best choice for new development.

# Usage

You can either use the Maven artifact or do a local installation and setup of Maven.

## Maven artifact

If you are using Maven artifact, simply add the following dependency to your pom.xml file in a newly created/generated Maven App:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.clearblade</groupId>
  <artifactId>clearblade-cloud-iot</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Local Installation and setup

For local installation of Maven:

In the [clearblade-cloud-iot](./clearblade-cloud-iot) folder, run the following command to install the libraries and build the sample with
Maven:

    mvn clean install

## Quickstart

1. From the [ClearBlade Migration from Google IoT Core section](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/2202664969/Migration+from+Google+IoT+Core)
   migrate your existing Google IoT Core registries and/or devices into ClearBlade IoT Core or using the
   ClearBlade IoT Core Console, [create a device registry and devices](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/2202206388/Creating+registries+and+devices).

2. [Add service accounts to a project](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/2240675843/Add+service+accounts+to+a+project) and download the json file with your service
   accountâ€™s credentials.

3. Use the following to set your environment variables keys in your terminal or IDE environment configurations:

   ```
    export CLEARBLADE_CONFIGURATION=/path/to/file.json
   ```

   Optional

   ```
    export CLEARBLADE_REGISTRY=[your-registry]
    export CLEARBLADE_REGION=[your-region]
   ```

4. Use the HTTP or MQTT samples in the [samples](./clearblade-cloud-iot/samples) folder.

## ClearBlade IoT Core Samples Java

The sample apps demonstrates registry and device creation for ClearBlade IoT Core. The [samples](./clearblade-cloud-iot/samples) folder contains all the Java samples that demonstrate an overview of the ClearBlade IoT Core platform.

Note that before you can run the sample, you must configure your development environment
and terminal as described in the Quickstart above or the [samples](./clearblade-cloud-iot/samples) folder.

Before running the samples, you must set the `CLEARBLADE_CONFIGURATION`. Optionally set the `CLEARBLADE_REGISTRY` and
`CLEARBLADE_REGION` environment variables to avoid changing them in the the sample app every time you run it.

When switching to use new registries and/or regions, either:

1. Update the `CLEARBLADE_REGISTRY` and `CLEARBLADE_REGION` environment variables; or
2. Change the `REGISTRY` and/or `REGION` in the sample code/app.

## Running the sample

The following command summarizes the sample usage:

Run registry example:

    mvn exec:java \
    	-Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false \
        -Dexec.mainClass="com.clearblade.cloud.iot.v1.samples.createdeviceregistry.SyncCreateDeviceRegistry" \
    	-DprojectName="your-project-id" \
    	-Dlocation="your-region" \
    	-DregistryName="your-registry"

Run device example:

    mvn exec:java \
    	-Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false \
        -Dexec.mainClass="com.clearblade.cloud.iot.v1.samples.createdevice.AsyncCreateDevice" \
    	-DprojectName="your-project-id" \
    	-Dlocation="your-region" \
    	-DregistryName="your-registry" \
    	-DdeviceName="your-device-id" \
